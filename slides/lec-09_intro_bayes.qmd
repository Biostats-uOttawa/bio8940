* For many years – until recently – Bayesian ideas in statistics 
were widely dismissed, often without much thought
* Advocates of Bayes had to fight hard to be heard, leading to
an ‘us against the world’ mentality – & predictable backlash
* Today, debates tend be less acrimonious, and more tolerant

# Bayes' Theorem

## Formal

Bayes' theorem is the results in a conditional probability of two events:

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
$$
P[A|B] = \frac{P[A\ \&\ B]}{P[B]} = \frac{P[B|A]  P[A]}{P[B]}
$$

. . .

:::


The conditional probability of A given B is the conditional probability ob B given A scaled by the relative probability of A compared to B.

$$
\underbrace{P[A|B]}_\text{posterior probability} = \frac{\overbrace{P[B|A]}^\text{likelihood} \cdot \overbrace{P[A]}^\text{prior probability}}{\underbrace{P[B]}_\text{marginal probability}}
$$

## Reframed for hypothesis

Bayes' theorem can be seen as the conditonal probability of a hypothesis given the data:
$$
P[H_0 | \text{data}] = \frac{\overbrace{P[\text{data}|H_0]}^\text{likelihood} \cdot  \overbrace{P[H_0]}^\text{prior}}{P[data]}
$$

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
. . .
:::

Or it can be seen as
$$
\underbrace{P[H_0 | \text{data}]}_{\text{what we want to know}} = \frac{\overbrace{P[\text{data}|H_0]}^\text{what frequentist do} \cdot \overbrace{P[H_0]}^\text{what we have a hard time understanding}}{\underbrace{P[data]}_\text{what we happily ignore}}
$$

# Bayesian inference

Same thing but with probabilities instead of number of observations

## Bayes' Theorem

Bayes’ Theorem is a rule about the ‘language’ of probabilities, that can be used in any analysis
describing random variables, i.e. any data analysis.

[Q. So why all the fuss?]{.emph}

A. Bayesian inference uses more than just Bayes’ Theorem

Bayesian inference uses the ‘language’ of probability to describe what is known
about parameters.

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

:::

::: {.callout-warning .large}
Frequentist inference, e.g. using p-values & confidence intervals, does not quantify what is known about parameters. many people initially think it does; an important job for instructors of intro Stat/Biostat courses is convincing those people that they are wrong

## Frequentist testing 

* imagine running your experiment again and again, so
  * On day 1 you collect data and construct a [valid] 95% confidence interval for a parameter $\theta_1$. 
  * On day 2 you collect new data and construct a 95% confidence interval for an unrelated parameter $\theta_2$.
  * On day 3 ... [the same]. and so on constructing confidence intervals each time
* ... 95% of your intervals will trap the true parameter value

# Bayesian inference

## Updating knowledge

We use:

* [**Prior distribution**]{.underline}: what you know about parameter β, excluding the information in the data – denoted $P_{prior}(β)$
* [**Likelihood**]{.underline}: based on modeling assumptions, how [relatively] likely the data Y are if the truth is β - denoted $f(Y|β)$

To get a posterior distribution, denoted $P_{post}(β|Y)$: stating what we know about β combining the prior with the data – ?

Bayes Theorem used for inference tells us:

$$
\begin{align}
P_{post}(β|Y) &∝ f(Y|β) × P_{prior}(β)\\
\text{Posterior} &∝ \text{Likelihood} × \text{Prior}
\end{align}
$$

[... and that’s it! (essentially!)]{.emph}

::: {.notes}
* No replications – e.g. no replicate plane searches
* Given modeling assumptions & prior, process is automatic
* Keep adding data, and updating knowledge, as data becomes
available... knowledge will concentrate around true β

## Where do priors come from

Priors come from all data external to the current study (*i.e.* everything else)
‘Boiling down’ what subject-matter experts know/think is known as eliciting a prior.
It’s not easy but here are some simple tips

* Discuss parameters experts understand – e.g. code variables so intercept is mean outcome in people with average covariates, not with age = height = ... = 0
* Avoid leading questions (just as in survey design)
* The ‘language’ of probability is unfamiliar, help users express their uncertainty

* Ideas to help experts ‘translate’ to the language of probability
* Typically these ‘coarse’ priors are smoothed. Providing the
basic shape remains, exactly how much you smooth is unlikely
to be critical in practice.
* Elicitation is also very useful for non-Bayesian analyses – it’s
similar to study design & analysis planning
:::

## Where do priors come from

If the experts disagree? Try it both ways

\

If the posteriors differ, what you believe based on the data **depends** on your prior knowledge

\

[To convince other people, expect to have to convince skeptics – and note that **convincing [rational] skeptics** is what science is all about]{.emph}

# When priors don't matter (much)?

## Very informative data

When the data provide a lot more information than the prior

```{r}
#| echo: false
dat <- data.frame(x = seq(0, 1, len = 1000)) %>%
  mutate(
    pr_1 = dbeta(x, 4, 16),
    pr_2 = dbeta(x, 16, 4),
    lik = dbeta(x, 300, 200),
    pr_lik_1 = pr_1 * lik,
    ps_1 = pr_lik_1 / sum(pr_lik_1) * sum(pr_1),
    pr_lik_2 = pr_2 * lik,
    ps_2 = pr_lik_2 / sum(pr_lik_2) * sum(pr_2)
  )
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pr_1, color = "pr"), linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pr_2, color = "pr"), linewidth = 1.5, linetype = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = lik, color = "lik"), linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_area(aes(y = lik, color = "lik", fill = "lik"), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ps_1, color = "ps"), linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ps_2, color = "ps"), linewidth = 1.5, linetype = 2) +
  labs(x = "Parameter value", y = "Probability density", color = "", fill = "") +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("lik" = "yellow", "pr" = "red", "pr" = "red", "ps" = "orange"),
    labels = c("Likelihood", "Prior", "Posterior")
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lik" = "yellow")) +
  guides(fill = "none")
```

Priors here are dominated by the likelihood, and they give very similar posteriors – i.e. everyone agrees. (Phew!)

## Flat priors

Using very flat priors to represent ignorance

```{r}
#| echo: false
dat <- data.frame(x = seq(0, 1, len = 1000)) %>%
  mutate(
    pr = dunif(x, 0, 1),
    lik = dbeta(x, 60, 40),
    pr_lik = pr * lik,
    ps = pr_lik / sum(pr_lik) * sum(pr),
  )
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pr, color = "pr"), linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = lik, color = "lik"), linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_area(aes(y = lik, color = "lik", fill = "lik"), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ps, color = "ps"), linewidth = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Parameter value", y = "Probability density", color = "", fill = "") +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("lik" = "yellow", "pr" = "red", "pr" = "red", "ps" = "orange"),
    labels = c("Likelihood", "Prior", "Posterior")
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lik" = "yellow")) +
  guides(fill = "none")
```

Flat priors do [NOT]{.emph} actually represent ignorance!

Most of their support is for very extreme parameter values

Likelihood gives the classic 95% confidence interval can be good approx of Bayesian 95% Highest Posterior Density interval

## Bayesian $\approx$ frequentist

With large samples (and some regularity conditions)

* (sane) frequentist confidence intervals and (sane) Bayesian credible intervals are essentially identical

* it’s actually okay to give Bayesian interpretations to 95% CIs,
i.e. to say we have $\neq$ 95% posterior belief that the true β lies within that range

## Frequentist :smiley: & Bayesian :confused:

Prior strongly supporting small effects, and with data from an imprecise study

```{r}
#| echo: false
dat <- data.frame(x = seq(-2, 5, len = 1001)) %>%
  mutate(
    pr = dnorm(x, 0, 0.5),
    lik = dnorm(x, 2.2, 1),
    pr_lik = pr * lik,
    ps = pr_lik / sum(pr_lik) * sum(pr),
  )
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pr, color = "pr"), linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = lik, color = "lik"), linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_area(aes(y = lik, color = "lik", fill = "lik"), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ps, color = "ps"), linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(x = 2.2, y = 0.05, xmin = qnorm(0.025, 2.2, 1), xmax = qnorm(0.975, 2.2, 1))) +
  labs(x = "Parameter value", y = "Probability density", color = "", fill = "") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0), color = "grey", linetype = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("lik" = "yellow", "pr" = "red", "pr" = "red", "ps" = "orange"),
    labels = c("Likelihood", "Prior", "Posterior")

::: {.notes}
Frequentist ‘Textbook’ analysis says ‘reject’ (p < 0.05, woohoo, Nature her we go)

Bayesian Posterior is ‘shrunk’ toward zero. We’re sure true β is very small (& hard to replicate) & we’re unsure of its sign. Wait a second, about that front page

## Where is Bayesian approach used

* Almost any analysis

* Bayesian arguments are often seen in
  
  * Hierarchical modeling (Some expert calls the classic frequentist version a “statistical no-man’s land”)

  * Complex models: for messy data, measurement error, multiple sources of data   fitting them is possible under Bayesian approaches, but perhaps still not easy

# Summary

## Bayesian statistics:

* I barely scratched the surface

* Is useful in many settings, and you should know about it

* Is often not very different in practice from frequentist statistics. It is often helpful to think about analyses from both Bayesian and non-Bayesian points of view

* Is not reserved for hard-core mathematicians, or computer scientists, or philosophers. If you find it helpful, use it.
